    <h1>Basic Information</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>What is your name?</li>
        <p>My name is <span>Victor Farrel Angelo A. Beso</span>. I prefer the nickname <span>Farrel</span>.</p>
        
        <li>What is your favorite CMSC subject so far and why?</li>
        <p><span>CMSC 22 (Object-Oriented Programming)</span> is my favorite subject so far.
        Back then I did not understand other aspects of the <span>Java Programming Language</span> which often occurs in
        the practical applications of the language itself, such as the creation of mobile applications.
        Now that I have a proper grasp on <span>OOP</span> topics such as <span>inheritance</span>, 
        <span>polymorphism</span>, and <span>concurrency</span>,
        I could finally understand other people's Java code, and also create a software application from
        it using <span>JavaFX</span>.</p>
        
        <li>What is your favorite GE so far and why?</li>
        <p>I am not a huge fan of GE subjects, but if I have to pick one, it would be <span>ARTS 1</span>.
        It's quite eye-opening that art itself is a <span>political concept</span> and is beyond the modernist notion
        that art is merely for pure <span>aesthetics</span>. It also emphasizes the <span>socio-political and economical</span> impact 
        of the perceiver of an art object and the one who (or that) created the piece.</p>
        
        <li>What is your favorite programming language and why?</li>
        <p>I am conflicted in choosing between <span>Java</span> and <span>C</span>.
         But if I have to choose one, it's <span>C</span>. I am amazed at it's primitivity and the nostalgia
         that it imbues. <span>C</span> is able to perform fascinating low level tasks, such creating an OS.</p>

        <li>What is your favorite food?</li>
        <p><span>Pizza</span>. Perhaps it's because it's an all-encompassing food since theoretically,
        any toppings could be placed based on their nutritional preferences as long as one has the flat bread.</p>
    
        <li>What are your hobbies?</li>
        <p>My hobbies are quite simple, it's a cycle of browsing <span>Facebook</span>, <span>Youtube</span>, 
        <span>Reddit</span>, and playing <span>Genshin Impact</span>. However, these hobbies take only a fraction of my day 
        so I additonally learn educational topics from the Internet, mostly <span>STEAM</span> related.</p>

        <li>What was your childhood dream?</li>
        <p>It was to be a <span>doctor</span>. However, I was quite fickle in my aspirations back then.
         It continued to evolve and mutate, like a dialectic, until I was certain that <span>computer related courses</span> was the one for me.
         It's amazing how my NCAE results predicted that I would enroll in a computer related course.</p>
